Extended Testsuite:

Positive Integration Tests:

- Variable assignment and printing (in test/e2e/let-print.grp)
    Assigns to and prints a string varaible

- Nested Functions (in test/e2e/functions-nested.grp)
    Call a function which defines and calls another function inside its body

- Function parameters (in test/e2e/functions-param.grp)
    Call a function which takes another function as a parameter

- Function returns (in test/e2e/functions-return.grp)
    Call a function which returns another function, calling the result

- Function pointer assignment (in test/e2e/functions-assign.grp)
    Assigns a function to a new name, calling that version of the function

- Structs (in test/e2e/struct.grp)
    Declares a struct type, initializes a struct, then prints the result of adding together
    two of the struct's fields

- Structs containing other constantly declared Structs (in test/e2e/struct-of-struct-const.grp)
    Intializes a struct with other structs as its fields and extracts the contents of an
    inner struct field 


Semantically Negative Integration Tests:
- Type Mismatch (in test/e2e/let-mistmatch.fail.grp)
    Let binding where the declared type doesn't match the type of the supplied expression
        Specifically, binding a String to a variable declared as an Int
    Expect semantic failure for mismatched types

- Duplicate Function Names (in test/e2e/functions-duplicate.fail.grp)
    Two functions declared with the same name, but in different scopes
      ***Note: our language requires globally unique functions names, even if the declarations
         are in different scope
    Expect semantic failure for duplicate function names

- Incorrect Function Parameter
    A function is called with a parameter of the wrong type
    Expect semantic failure for mismatched parameter type



*** Note - every .grp test has a golden standard output stored in the corresponding .out file
