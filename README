Run all commands in the current directory.

Extended Testsuite:

Run all integraton tests with the command "make e2e_test"
    See "General Compilation Notes" below for the other compilation commands

Positive Integration Tests:

- Variable assignment and printing (in test/e2e/let-print.grp)
    Assigns to and prints a string varaible

- Nested Functions (in test/e2e/functions-nested.grp)
    Call a function which defines and calls another function inside its body

- Function parameters (in test/e2e/functions-param.grp)
    Call a function which takes another function as a parameter

- Function returns (in test/e2e/functions-return.grp)
    Call a function which returns another function, calling the result

- Function pointer assignment (in test/e2e/functions-assign.grp)
    Assigns a function to a new name, calling that version of the function

- Structs (in test/e2e/struct.grp)
    Declares a struct type, initializes a struct, then prints the result of adding together
    two of the struct's fields

- Structs containing other constantly declared Structs (in test/e2e/struct-of-struct-const.grp)
    Intializes a struct with other structs as its fields and extracts the contents of an
    inner struct field 


Semantically Negative Integration Tests:
- Type Mismatch (in test/e2e/let-mistmatch.fail.grp)
    Let binding where the declared type doesn't match the type of the supplied expression
        Specifically, binding a String to a variable declared as an Int
    Expect semantic failure for mismatched types

- Duplicate Function Names (in test/e2e/functions-duplicate.fail.grp)
    Two functions declared with the same name, but in different scopes
      ***Note: our language requires globally unique functions names, even if the declarations
         are in different scope
    Expect semantic failure for duplicate function names

- Incorrect Function Parameter (in test/e2e/functions-param-mismatch.fail.grp)
    Calls a function with a parameter of the wrong type
        Specifically, the function expects an Int, but a String is passed in
    Expect semantic failure for mismatched parameter type

*** Note - every .grp test has a golden standard output stored in the corresponding .out file
All of these (.grp and .out) files are located in the directory test/e2e




General Compilation Notes:

Compile the Grouper Compiler into an executable with: 
    `make`
The executable is `./src/toplevel.native`
    
Clean the Grouper Compiler with:
    `make clean`

Run the Extended Testsuite with:
    `make e2e_test`
The output will be green if the test passes, and red otherwise

Compile a program and view all stages of compilation with:
    `make compile in=<Grouper source file>`
The AST is written to `ast.out`
The SAST is written to `sast.out`
The generated LLVM is written to `llvm.out`
The compiled, executable program is written to `out`

Compile Grouper source code with:
    `./src/toplevel.native (-a|-s|-l|-c) [filename.grp]`
    Compiler flags (one of 4 actions):
    `-a` prints out the AST
    `-s` prints out the SAST
    `-l` prints out the generated LLVM
    `-c` validates the generated LLVM and prints it out if it is valid
