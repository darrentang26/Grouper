Compile with: ocamlbuild toplevel.native

Run the validation script with: `python3 validation.py`. Note that before this
script is run, compile the toplevel.native file with the above command. This
script runs the toplevel.native executable on a curated variety of inputs,
located in the ../test/scanner_parser directory (along with accompanying
expected output for passing tests in the corresponding .out files).

We have all of the syntax that we initially set out to implement, including:
- ADTs
- Structs (records in OCaml-speak)
- User-defined types
- Lambda functions
- Pattern matching
- Let variable declarations
- Literals for ints, floats, booleans, and strings
- Algebraic structure (groups, rings, fields) support
- Tuples and lists

Syntax to add:
- Arbitrary Length Tuples
- Some/None support
